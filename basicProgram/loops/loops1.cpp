// Loop - a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached. 

//There are mainly two types of loops:  

// Entry Controlled loops: In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.

// Exit Controlled Loops: In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

//1.	while loop – First checks the condition, then executes the body.
// 2.	for loop – firstly initializes, then, condition check, execute body, update.
// 3.	do-while loop – firstly, execute the body then condition check
