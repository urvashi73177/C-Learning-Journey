Important Points
Use for a loop when a number of iterations are known beforehand, i.e. the number of times the loop body is needed to be executed is known.
Use while loops, where an exact number of iterations is not known but the loop termination condition, is known.
Use do while loop if the code needs to be executed at least once like in Menu-driven programs


// Loop - a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached. 

//There are mainly two types of loops:  

// Entry Controlled loops: In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and While Loop is entry-controlled loops.

// Exit Controlled Loops: In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

//1.	while loop – First checks the condition, then executes the body.
//2.	for loop – firstly initializes, then, condition check, execute body, update.
//3.	do-while loop – firstly, execute the body then condition check


Q- when to use for loop?
A for loop is typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. The loop will continue executing until the condition becomes false.

Q- When to use while loop ? 
A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. The condition is evaluated before executing the loop, and the loop continues as long as the condition is true.

Q- When to use DoWhile loop ?
Python doesn't have a built-in do-while loop like some other programming languages. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a while loop with a conditional statement that determines whether to continue or exit the loop.

//Remember that the choice of loop construct depends on the problem and specific requirements. Use a for loop when you know the number of iterations, a while loop when the number of iterations is uncertain, and emulate a do-while loop using a while loop when you want to ensure the code block executes at least once before checking the condition.
