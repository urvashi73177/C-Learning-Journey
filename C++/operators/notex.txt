What are operators in C?
Operators in C are certain symbols in C used for performing certain mathematical, relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical operations for the user.

What is the difference between the ‘=’ and ‘==’ operators?
‘=’ is a type of assignment operator that places the value in right to the variable on left, Whereas ‘==’ is a type of relational operator that is used to compare two elements if the elements are equal or not.

What is the difference between prefix and postfix operators in C?
Prefix operations are the operations in which the value is returned prior to the operation whereas in postfix operations value is returned after updating the value in the variable.

Example:
b=c=10;
a=b++;    // a==10
a=++c;    // a==11

What is the Modulo operator?
The Modulo operator(%) is used to find the remainder if one element is divided by another.

Example:
a % b (a divided by b)
5 % 2 == 1


Types of Operators in C
C has many built-in operators and can be classified into 6 types:

Arithmetic Operators - These operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: (+, -, *, /, %,++,–). Arithmetic operators are of two types: 


Relational Operators => These are used for the comparison of the values of two operands (a<b)

Logical Operators- Logical Operators are used to combining two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a Boolean value either true or false. (cout<<((4 != 5) && (4 < 5));     // true)


Bitwise Operators- The Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. The operators are first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed on the operands. (int a = 5, b = 9;   // a = 5(00000101), b = 9(00001001)
cout << (a ^ b);   //  00001100
cout <<(~a);       // 11111010)

Assignment Operators- Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value (a'='b)

Different types of assignment operators are shown below: 

“+=”
This operator is the combination of the ‘+’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first adds the current value of the variable on left to the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left. 
Example:

(a += b) can be written as (a = a + b)
If initially value stored in a is 5. Then (a += 6) = 11.

“-=” 
This operator is a combination of ‘-‘ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first subtracts the value on the right from the current value of the variable on left and then assigns the result to the variable on the left. 
Example:

(a -= b) can be written as (a = a - b)
If initially value stored in a is 8. Then (a -= 6) = 2.

“*=” 
This operator is a combination of the ‘*’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first multiplies the current value of the variable on left to the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left. 
Example:

(a *= b) can be written as (a = a * b)
If initially, the value stored in a is 5. Then (a *= 6) = 30.


“/=”
This operator is a combination of the ‘/’ and ‘=’ operators. This operator first divides the current value of the variable on left by the value on the right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.
